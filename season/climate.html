          Nepal - Country Climate and Development Report
          <a title="cedarcirclefarm.org" href="https://cedarcirclefarm.org/"
            >Vermont farm</a
          >, As temperatures rise across South Asia, climate and disaster risks
          in Nepal are expected to increase further, affecting people, the
          economy, the environment, and development gains. Nepal’s temperature
          is projected to increase by about 0.9 C between 2016 and 2045 under a
          medium-range emissions pathway. Winters are projected to be drier and
          monsoon summers wetter, with up to a threefold increase in rainfall.
          The number of people in Nepal annually affected by river flooding
          caused by climate change could double to around 350,000 in 2030 (from
          157,000 in 2010).
        </p>

        <p>
          While Nepal has low per capita emissions and is a negligible
          contributor to global climate change, agricultural and energy-related
          emissions are also a key source of air pollution, with major negative
          economic implications. Emissions come primarily from agriculture (54
          percent) and energy (28 percent. Between 2012 and 2019, Nepal’s
          emissions increased by 26.9 percent, primarily due to growing energy
          consumption in energy and industry, which accounted for 28.3 percent
          and 7.4 percent of Nepal’s GHG emissions in 2019. Biomass, transport,
          open burning, and industrial activities also contribute significantly
          to air pollution, with sizeable negative impacts on health and
          productivity.

        <p>
          It’s possible to halt and even reverse this process through better
          agricultural policies and practices. Unfortunately, the world leaders
          who this past week have paid little attention to the critical links
          between climate change and agriculture. That’s a huge mistake and a
          missed opportunity. Our unsustainable farming methods are a central
          contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change, quite simply,
          cannot be halted without fixing agriculture.

          Climate variability is impacting the Nepali economy through lower
          agricultural productivity, road damage, and high energy imports during
          the dry season, among other impacts. Floods and landslides have been
          the most frequent hazards over the past 40 years; these events are
          expected to increase as climate change accelerates. While southern and
          urban municipalities are more likely to experience flooding and heat
          stress, northern regions are affected by increased erosion,
          landslides, water stress, and glacial lake overflow. The most
          vulnerable communities often live in the most extreme

          That loss has significantly degraded soil health, reducing our ability
          to grow food. Median crop yields are likely to decline by about ,
          according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. At
          the same time, the world’s population is projected to jump from 7
          billion to 9 billion by 2050.

          Water availability is also at risk. Currently, environments that are
          subject to climate impacts and lack social protection programs. Women,
          indigenous people, and other marginalized communities are
          disproportionately affected. Nepal has begun to put in place the
          necessary policy framework, such as the 2019 National Climate Change
          Policy, the 2022 Solid Waste Management Policy, the 2022 Forest
          Regulation, and the 2022 Land Use Regulation. However, implementation
          of this reform agenda and prioritization of investments is incipient.
          Moreover, enhanced prioritization and efficiency of public expenditure
          are required to maximize climate and development benefits.

          of all water consumption. That’s in large part because degraded soil
          doesn’t absorb water efficiently. Instead, water sits on top of the
          ground and runs off (along with farm chemicals) into nearby waterways,
          creating toxic nitrogen “dead zones.”

        <p>
          Remarkably, though, restoring carbon to the soil is not nearly as
          complicated as rethinking our transportation systems or replacing coal
          with renewable energy. Innovative farmers such as Allen already know
          the recipe.

          He and his team place “cover crops” in their fields, planting things
          like oats, rye and beans between rows of vegetables. This practice
          keeps carbon, nitrogen and other organic nutrients in the soil.
          “Keeping as much ground covered with plants as long as possible allows
          photosynthesis to draw down atmospheric carbon into soils,” Allen
          says. A bare field, in contrast, represents a waste of photosynthetic
          potential. Allen also composts, limits plowing and avoids synthetic
          chemicals like nitrogen fertilizers. In combination, these efforts
          have increased soil organic matter by 3 to 4 percent in just three
          years. Allen also sells some of his cover crops, adding farm income.

          This Country Climate and Development Report outlines four priority
          system transitions that are fundamental to addressing the risks that
          climate change poses to Nepal while also providing opportunities for
          improving the quality and sustainability of economic development: (a)
          improving systemic resilience of rural landscapes including food,
          freshwater, and forest systems to boost adaptation, livelihoods, and
          food security; (b) harnessing Nepal’s significant hydropower
          opportunities; (c) managing urbanization and environmental quality to
          build resilience and improve health; and (d) strengthening Nepal’s
          low-carbon, resilient connectivity — particularly roads — to improve
          the country’s growth and services. This report also outlines three key
          enabling themes to help support the priority system transitions toward
          a greener future for Nepal: strengthening the resilience of people and
          community assets through early warning systems, shock-responsive
          safety nets, and access to quality skills training; embedding disaster
          risk management at all tiers of government and across all sectors; and
          prioritizing Nepal’s funding needs by convening and coordinating
          financing for climate action.

          Regenerative farming would also increase the fertility of the land,
          making it more productive and better able to absorb and hold water, a
          critical function especially in times of climate-related floods and
          droughts. Carbon-rich fields require less synthetic nitrogen
          fertilizer and generate more productive crops, cutting farmer
          expenses… Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate change and has already
          experienced changes in temperature and precipitation at a faster rate
          than the global average. Due to its geography, Nepal is exposed to a
          range of climate risks and water-related hazards triggered by rapid
          snow- and ice-melt in the mountains and torrential rainfall episodes
          in the foothills during the monsoon season
